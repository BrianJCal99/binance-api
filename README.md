## CoinStream: Real-Time Crypto Market Data Streaming
CoinStream is a dynamic web application designed to provide users with real-time cryptocurrency market data using Binance's WebSocket API. Leveraging the power of Lightweight Charts, the platform delivers seamless and interactive visualizations of live price movements, order book updates, and trade history. Built for traders and crypto enthusiasts, CoinStream offers a responsive and intuitive interface to monitor market trends and make informed decisions. This project showcases my expertise in real-time data streaming, front-end development, and financial data visualization.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
